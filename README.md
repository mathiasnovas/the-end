# The End

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

'The End' is an immersive audio visual experience combining binaural audio and virtual reality using A-Frame.

## How to use (on a phone)

1. Navigate to the demo on your phone: https://mathiasnovas.github.io/the-end/

2. Add the website to your homescreen. **This is important** to remove your browser's UI.

3. Hit the *VR* button in the bottom right corner to start the experience.

4. Connect your headphones, put your phone into your cardboard-like VR headgear, and enjoy!

### Notes

The prepared audio is roughly 5 minutes long.

If you don't see anything after hitting the *VR* button, try refreshing (or re-adding to homescreen).

The experience might vary on older phones.
